LAPS

LAPS was actually very easy to setup.
Started with https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1P2iPWZCMLk&pp=ygURaW50dW5lIGxhcHMgc2V0dXA%3D

You want to log into Entra/Azure
Devices > Device Settings > Scroll down and "Enable Azure AD Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) (Preview)
Log into Intune
Endpoint Security > Account Protection > Create New Policy > Plat - Win10+ | Profile - LAPS
Configure the Policy and wait mayne 10-15min. GO get a drink/snack and come back.

Easy. Entra/Azure portal (under devices) has a section for LAPS, which shows ALL DEVICES ina  list with their passwords. 
Intune, you can select the devices and go select a device and view the left column options for "Local Admin Password"

I really did not expect LAPS to be so EASY.

Looking at the Bitlocker configs in Intune.... Those seem a lot more complicated due to to HOW MANY configurable options there are. I'll skip for now.


Checking out some Windows Compliance settings. Create first one. 
Requires: Secure Boot, TPM.

Working.
