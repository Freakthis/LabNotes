Sept 3rd.
Broke my CM VM a week or so ago. THought I had a backup and went to revert the VM and Kaput. I'm currently making backups of certain items to redo the onprem lab.

Deleted the devices and users from Intune and deleted the VMs to crecreate the ONPREM Lab setup.

Following directions from the Lab guide. Step #47 - It's late, be back later.
