So I missed a few days worth of notes so here I Start fresh

Where I am at today. Today I need to figure out why my builds are not joining the domain.

Log: C:\Windows\debug\NetSetup.log

TS Step: "Apply Network Settings" is not applying the domain. I need to export a log but unfortunately I'm late on my notes and I already fixed it.
- New Group "Join Domain" - WMI condition "Select * From Win32_ComputerSystem Where PartofDomain = 'FALSE'
--"Set Dynam Variables" - OSDJoinSkipReboot = False, OSDJoinType = 0
--"Join Domain or Workgroup"

Notes - I feel stupid, I missed setting up a container VS OU.... While THe mahcine did join the domain after nearly 20MIN!!!!!!

"08/14/2023 17:06:48:809 NetpGetComputerObjectDn: Specified path 'CN=Computers,DC=corp,DC=contoso,DC=com' is not an OU"
"08/14/2023 17:08:39:184 NetpCreateComputerObjectInDs: NetpGetComputerObjectDn failed: 0x2"
"08/14/2023 17:08:39:184 NetpProvisionComputerAccount: LDAP creation failed: 0x2"
"08/14/2023 17:08:39:184 NetpProvisionComputerAccount: LDAP creation failed: 0x2"
"08/14/2023 17:08:39:184 NetpProvisionComputerAccount: Cannot retry downlevel, specifying OU is not supported"

Using https://www.moderndeployment.com/correct-domain-join-account-permissions/ as ref to set OU permissions.

I don't know yet if I have something miss configured or not yet regarding TS Step: "Apply Network Settings" TBD

With the new updated OU configured and the TS Steps updated to reference that new OU. Starting Build on VM11 (VM10 was successful, though long)

(Mental Notes) - Need MORE Storage on phys desktop AND more RAM. - I should MAX out RAM, and install 2x 2TB NVMe drives.

I am also happy to state that while my VM10 did join the domain, it was in Entra devices rather fast, and some bit later (need more info) it was in Intune.
I am also glad I forked Gary's Garytown repo and used the TS from https://garytown.com/osdcloud-configmgr-integrated-win11-osd --I am very good at build off what others have started, but doing mine from scratch... eh, not so much.

I also Need to create a proper answer file, Not sure if using Gary's is messing with my lab. I did check each linked github file to confirm if I needed to modify it or not. Maybe I just want more customizations.

The boot time between the FIRST TS Step "Restart Computer" is kind of obnoxious. I want faster build times.

Back to Domain issues. So fixed by adding in the follow up steps, time reduced after fixing OU issue (as detailed in log)

With domain join issues fixed... onto Answer Files.

Did some messing with starting a default GPO for the "VM Lab Builds" OU. I should look at STIGS (spelling?) https://www.stigviewer.com/stig/microsoft_windows_11/

ANNNNND ADD BRAIN KICK IN...

Added 2 scripts to CM

CHeck RSAT Install && Install RSAT missign features
https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-11/how-to-install-or-uninstall-rsat-in-windows-11/m-p/3273590

C:\Windows\CCM\Logs\Scripts.log

#1
Get-WindowsCapability -Name RSAT* -Online | Select-Object -Property DisplayName, State

#2
# Get RSAT items that are not currently installed:
$install = Get-WindowsCapability -Online |
  Where-Object {$_.Name -like "RSAT*" -AND $_.State -eq "NotPresent"}

# Install the RSAT items that meet the filter:
foreach ($item in $install) {
  try {
    Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name $item.name
  }
  catch [System.Exception] {
    Write-Warning -Message $_.Exception.Message
  }
}

Number 2 of which failed.

Probably because I disabled a bunch of windows update items from GPO... Undid those Win updates settings and attempting script again. TO be fair I wasn't planning RSAT before doing the GPOs.
- Allow Automatic Updates Immediate Installation
- Configure Automatic Updates
- Do not connect to any windows update internet locations
- Remove access to use all windows update features

The Script guid (found on the scripts from CM, May need to enable the column) will be listed in the scripts.log file.

VM12 - Going to test build times... (I do like the way Company handles logging, the HTML Report, and all those extra details.)
Start: 10:40
End: 11:00 
20min, not too bad. I am using a TS Step for a packaged Win11 install vs the OSD from the TS import.
-Lawl, First attempt failed... 'System.OutOfMemoryException' - Again, need more RAM.

Should have just used Prajwal https://www.prajwaldesai.com/how-to-install-rsat-on-windows-11/
CM Script output:
{
  "Path": null,
  "Online": true,
  "WinPath": null,
  "SysDrivePath": null,
  "RestartNeeded": false,
  "LogPath": "C:\\WINDOWS\\Logs\\DISM\\dism.log",
  "ScratchDirectory": null,
  "LogLevel": 2
}

It worked but in a weird way. there's no "folder" in the start menu like most people are used to. 

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/system-management-components/remote-server-administration-tools#rsat-for-windows-10-version-1809-or-later-versions
RSAT for Windows 10, version 1809 or later versions

*Note
You can't use the Turn Windows features on and off dialog from the Control Panel

Installing the RSAT Tools for Windows 10 version 1809 and later version is slightly different from earlier versions. RSAT is now part of the Operating System an can be installed via Optional Features.

https://www.systanddeploy.com/2020/01/install-rsat-on-windows-10-through.html - Ehhhhh, extra steps with XML? Idk

RSAT is going, not well. Uninstall works fine though. Should make sure I enable logging or something.
